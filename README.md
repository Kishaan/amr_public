Autonomous Mobile Robots
========================

This is supposed to be an "upstream" remote for your clone of the team
repository.

If your team number is 0, then the following commands will set up your clone:

```bash
cd ~/Workspace
git clone git@github.com:brsu-amr/team0.git amr
cd amr
git remote add upstream git@github.com:brsu-amr/amr-public.git
```
